# My Project

This is WIP collection of utilities to help with the management, administration and navigatin of duckdb and motherduck databases

This will help you connect to motherduck database, create new databases, install extensions or navigate between your various databases.

Eventually, I'll use the learning here to create a meta DB utilities package so that regardless if you're in snowflake, DuckDB, redshift, etc you will have generalized functions that work across your database types.

I try to leverage linux style commands to minimize mental overhead between switching in and other of langauges.

This is very much work in progress -- I'll eventually transition to the R7 object system but just want to get some usage first before deciding on the architecture and structure 

## Features

-   `pwd()` prints prints your current database that you are "in"
-   `ls()` lists the databases that you have access to
-   `cd()` will change your database environment
-   `summarize()` will summarize your database table's data
-   `connect_to_md()` will leverage your motherduck token to connect you to your motherduck instance (it will install motherduck extension if not created)
-   `install_extensions()` will install various duckdb extensions
-   `validate_*()` collection of functions will just validate your connection and extension status
-   `read_httpfs()` helps with reading httpfs formats
-   `read_parquet()` helps with reading parquet files
-   `create_or_replace_database()` will take R data and create a database with your data
